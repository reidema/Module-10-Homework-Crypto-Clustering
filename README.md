**Import the Data**

This section imports the data into a new DataFrame. It follows these steps:

Read the “crypto_market_data.csv” file from the Resources folder into a DataFrame, and use index_col="coin_id" to set the cryptocurrency name as the index. Review the DataFrame.

Generate the summary statistics, and use HvPlot to visualize your data to observe what your DataFrame contains.
